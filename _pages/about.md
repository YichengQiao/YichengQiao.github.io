    <section id="about-me">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
My ultimate goal of my research is to create safe and controllable strong AI that contributes to human civilization. On one hand, I am deeply interested in exploring specific applications such as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), 3D Computer Vision, Large Language and Vision Models, and Multimodality Learning. On the other hand, I want to conduct foundational research in AI, focusing on enhancing the transparency and reliability of machine learning models, making them more bio-inspired and intelligent.
